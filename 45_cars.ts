// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

    const car = {manufacturer,model, ... Object.fromEntries(additionalInfo)};
       return car;
    }
  const myCardetails =storecar ("toyota","corolla",['color','blue',],['year','2022']);
